                    L.F.R. Demolition was founded in 2017 with a clear purpose: to
                    deliver demolition and floor removal services with speed, safety,
                    and technical excellence. Operating primarily in the Fort Myers,
                    Cape Coral, and surrounding areas, this family-owned business has
                    grown based on client trust and meticulous attention to every

                    <strong>ðŸ”§ What We Do</strong>
                    <br /> We specialize in floor removal (tile, wood, carpet, VCT)
                    and interior demolition for kitchens, bathrooms, and partitions.
                    We use professional-grade tools such as automatic scrapers,
                    industrial HEPA vacuums, and air purifiers to ensure complete dust
                    control and a thoroughly clean worksite.
