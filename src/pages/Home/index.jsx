              L.F.R. Demolition was founded in 2017 with a clear purpose: to
              deliver demolition and floor removal services with speed, safety,
              and technical excellence. Operating primarily in the Fort Myers,
              Cape Coral, and surrounding areas, this family-owned business has
              grown based on client trust and meticulous attention to every

            <p>
              <strong>üîß What We Do</strong>
              <br /> We specialize in floor removal (tile, wood, carpet, VCT)
              and interior demolition for kitchens, bathrooms, and partitions.
              We use professional-grade tools such as automatic scrapers,
              industrial HEPA vacuums, and air purifiers to ensure complete dust
              control and a thoroughly clean worksite.
